# Welcome to My German Revision Helper ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

This site helps me review what I learn in German. It keeps my grammar, vocabulary, verbs, daily writing, and phrases in one clean place.

Each topic comes from my daily lessons. They are short, clear, and easy to go through. I can read grammar notes, learn new words, study verb forms, and see how they are used in sentences.

**I use this site to**

* Revise what I learn every day
* See how grammar and words fit together
* Watch my progress as I move from level A1 to higher levels

This site helps me **stay consistent, one small step at a time.**
