**Explanation:**  
German main clauses follow the **Verb-Second (V2)** rule: the conjugated verb always appears in the second position.  
Example: *Ein Fenster verschwindet* → “A window disappears.”  
Here, *Ein Fenster* is the **subject** in the **nominative case**, which always shows *who or what performs the action*.  
Formula: **Subject (Nominative) + Verb + Rest**
