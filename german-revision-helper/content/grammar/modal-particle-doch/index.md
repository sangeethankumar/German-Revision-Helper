**Explanation:**
**doch** adds emotional color to speech.
It can show surprise, contradiction, reassurance, or disbelief — depending on tone and context.
It doesn’t change the factual meaning, only the speaker’s attitude.

**Patterns & Examples:**

* **Disbelief:** *Sie **meinen doch nicht** Harry Potter?!* → *You don’t mean Harry Potter, do you?!*
* **Reassurance/contradiction:** *Das **ist doch** klar.* → *But that **is** clear.*

**Usage note:**
Very frequent in spoken German; tone determines meaning.
