**Explanation:**
Both mean *“when,”* but they are not interchangeable.

* **als** is used for **a single event in the past**.
* **wenn** is used for **repeated events** or **present/future** conditions.

**Formulas:**

* **Als** + dependent clause (verb at the end), main clause
* **Wenn** + dependent clause (verb at the end), main clause

**Examples:**

* *Als ich klein **war**, hatte ich einen Hund.* → *When I was little, I had a dog.*
* *Wenn es regnet, **bleibe** ich zu Hause.* → *When it rains, I stay home.*
