**Explanation:**
These adverbs mean *“suddenly”* or *“all of a sudden.”*
When an adverb begins a sentence, the **verb takes second position**, appearing right after it — this is called **inversion**.

**Formula:**

* **Plötzlich/Urplötzlich** + **Verb** + Subject + …

**Examples:**

* *Plötzlich **begann** es zu regnen.* → *Suddenly, it began to rain.*
* *Urplötzlich **wurde** es still.* → *All of a sudden, it became quiet.*

**Register:**

* **plötzlich** = neutral and common.
* **urplötzlich** = dramatic or literary; rarely used in work contexts.
