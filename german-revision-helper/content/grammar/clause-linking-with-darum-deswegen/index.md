**Explanation:**
**Darum** and **deswegen** both mean *“therefore / that’s why.”*
They connect two main clauses, and because they are **conjunctive adverbs**, the verb in the second clause comes **immediately after them** (word-order inversion).

**Formula:**

* [Reason clause], **darum/deswegen** + **Verb** + Subject + …

**Examples:**

* *Es regnet, **darum bleibe** ich zu Hause.* → *It’s raining, so I’m staying home.*
* *Ich bin müde, **deswegen gehe** ich früh ins Bett.* → *I’m tired, so I’m going to bed early.*

**Usage notes:**

* **Darum** sounds a little more conversational; **deswegen** is neutral.
* Both are extremely common in daily speech.
